1. [A giant exoplanet orbiting a very-low-mass star challenges planet formation models](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6460/1441)
+ Gas Giant of 0.4 M_J orbits M dwarfï¼Œwith eccentricity of 0.4 and semi-major axis of 0.3AU.
+ An outer exoplanet with unknown parameters need to be confirmed.
+ Hypothesis: the system formed initially with three planets, of which one (with a mass similar to or lower than that of planet b) was ejected, leaving GJ 3512 b on an eccentric orbit and a large gap between the two surviving planets.
+ Formation:  Migration occurs in gravitational instable and young-age disk.(Reading: [Formation of planets by gravitational instability](http://isdc.unige.ch/sf2015/lectures/kley/kley_lect07.pdf)

1. Constrain Hubble diagram using QSO and Pantheon
+ polynomial expansion of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?D_l): make sense in low red-shift
+ QSO + Pantheon calibrate ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?D_l)
+ ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\Omega_k~\frac{H(z)D_l'}{H_0D_l})
+ Error from H(z)
2. Cosmological test using the Hubble diagram of high-z quasars
+ Three methods to 
  + FWHM of Mg II to determine the luminosity in UV wavelength
  + FSRQ gamma ray luminosity function
  + the relation between X-ray and luminosity in UV wavelength 
+ $ D_l$: have dimension vs $ d_l $: no dimension:
+ BIC
