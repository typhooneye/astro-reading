1. [A giant exoplanet orbiting a very-low-mass star challenges planet formation models](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6460/1441)
+ Gas Giant of 0.4 M_J orbits M dwarfï¼Œwith eccentricity of 0.4 and semi-major axis of 0.3AU.
+ An outer exoplanet with unknown parameters need to be confirmed.
+ Hypothesis: the system formed initially with three planets, of which one (with a mass similar to or lower than that of planet b) was ejected, leaving GJ 3512 b on an eccentric orbit and a large gap between the two surviving planets.
+ Formation:  Migration occurs in gravitational instable and young-age disk.
