## 1. U12A: Inversion and Uncertainty Quantification in the Geosciences

### A. MCMC and High Order Derivative Tensor Trains

1. Approximate parameter-to-observable map -> high order Taylor series
   * Jacobian ($\frac{df}{dx}$) + higher derivative terms ($\frac{d^nf}{dx^n} n =2,3,...$)
   * If the nonlinear is strong -> higher derivative terms matters
2. "Tensor-free" tensor free
   *  $\frac{df}{dx}$ Matrix; $\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$ -3 tensor; $\frac{d^3f}{dx^3}$- 4 tensor; ...
   * Reduce the n-order tensor to a series of 3-tensor
3. Can be applied to inverse problem
4. **Take Away**:
   * Riemannian manifold MCMC (RMHMC) can achieve high acceptance rates and large step sizes for non-Gaussian posteriors by incorporating information from high order derivative tensors.
   * "tensor-free'' tensor train compression can trace it.



### B. Greedy Multi-scale Surrogates for Uncertainty Quantification

* Usage; 
  * It greedily learns the structure of the underlying physics using a sparsity constraint that is shown to promote modeling stability.
* Advantages:
  * Not like kernel-driven Gaussian process, this method only need one hyper parameter.



## 2. Search for habitable conditions in the outer solar system

* The habitable zone may be larger than originally conceived. The strong gravitational pull caused by the giant planets may produce enough energy to sufficiently heat the cores of orbiting icy moons. This could mean that some of the strongest candidates for harbouring extraterrestrial life are located outside the solar habitable zone, on satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. 
* Saturn
  * Titan - dune world 
    * Rainstorm?
    * Surface has strong latitude-dependency:
      * Three different albedo
    * Active chemistry
  * Enceladus
    * Heat Source?
    * Plume:
      * Saturn's small, icy moon Enceladus captured the imaginations of people worldwide when NASA's Cassini spacecraft saw it spewing plumes of water into space. This water comes from a global, liquid ocean concealed beneath Enceladus' fissured crust

* **Glaciovolcanism** is [volcanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanism) and related phenomena associated with glacial ice. The ice commonly constrains the erupted material and melts to create [meltwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltwater). Considerable melting of glacial ice can create massive [lahars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahar) and glacial outburst [floods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood) known as [jökulhlaups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jökulhlaup).

  * Hypoxic: low exgen

## 2. Atmospheric Convection: Processes, Dynamics, and Links to Weather and Climate III

 * convective self-aggregation
   - Convective self-aggregation is the spontaneous spatial organization of convection in numerical simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium despite
   homogeneous boundary conditions and forcing. This instability of the RCE
   state arises due to interactions among convection, radiation, environmental
   moisture, and surface fluxes.
 * Red noise:
   - The term "red noise" comes from the "white noise"/"white light" analogy; red noise is strong in longer wavelengths, similar to the red end of the visible spectrum.

### C. Seasonal Delay of Tropical Rainfall
* GHG forcing weakens the delay
* Aerosol forcing enhance the delay

### D. "Dry get Wetter" paradigm in China
* Caused by the horizontal and vertical moisture.

### H. The midlatitude response to polar sea ice loss and melting: Idealized slab-ocean aquaplanet experiments with thermodynamic sea ice
* The sea ice loss weakens the mid-latitude circulation
  - Larger Extent -> more weakening 
  -  Deeper mixed layer -> more weakening
  -  Explanation: More mean avaliable potential energy
  
* an energetic mechanism of weakening of the storm track in response to sea ice loss.
  - sea ice loss increases the absorption of shortwave radiation by the surface
      *  (due to the decrease of surface albedo)
  -  absorption of radiation drives an increase in surface turbulent fluxes into the atmosphere 
  -  more energy in atmosphere weaken poleward atmospheric energy transport. 
    +  The storm track weakens because it dominates poleward energy transport.
    

### Wednesday
