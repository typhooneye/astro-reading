* only the terrestrial planet or all of the planets including ice giant and gas giant

  * The high abundance of O suggests there should be the entire solar system

* Is a random sample or non-random sample?

  * Larger body is easy to be scattered?

  * Distance to the star? The asteroid belt?

  * Different layer of the planet? The crust first and then the mantle?

    -> Calculate the timescale of vaporation of the rocks

    $F = \frac{2\pi R_*^2T^4}{2\pi D^2}$

    $t = \frac{L\rho d^3}{F}$

    L is latent heat of the material of the planetesimal; d is the size, rho is the density

    -> t~3 months, so it will be quickly vaporized when it reaches 0.006AU
