### Analytical Modelling of Exoplanet Transit Specroscopy with Dimensional Analysis and Symbolic Regression


* the use of dimensional analysis to identify the relevant combinations of physical parameters (the so-called Pi
groups Barenblatt (1996)) which uniquely determine the observed transit spectra. 
* Input Pi an then the use **symbolic regression** to derive
accurate analytical formulas representative of a typical forward model

### The relation between tectonics and habitability:

Planets without such plates are known as stagnant lid planets, coping with a crust made up of a single spherical plate floating on the mantle. Should we rule out such planets as candidates for life?

Penn State‚Äôs Foley, cited above, has been working with colleague Andrew Smye on computer models that probe the idea. The scientists wanted to learn whether climate regulation through chemical weathering could be sustained on a stagnant lid planet,a place where there is no subduction and the recycling of surface material back into the mantle would be limited. On such a world, the development of continents and their productive collisions would not occur, although as the paper points out, volcanism can still release some mantle CO2 to the atmosphere, allowing for at least some degree of surface recycling through lava flows.


### Why high-O2 is not a bio signalÔºü

The early development of abiotic, oxygen-rich atmospheres could prevent the subsequent emergence of life by precluding prebiotic chemistry (Wordsworth et al., 2018). It has also been argued that the spectral energy distributions of M-dwarfs are favorable for the photochemical accumulation of O2 and O3.

### KBO:

![](figures/TheKuiperBelt_100AU_SDO.svg)


* Kuiper belt:
	- the Kuiper belt is a relatively "round" and "flat" doughnut of space extending from about 30 AU to 44 AU with its member-objects locked in autonomously **circular** orbits ( cubewanos) or mildly-elliptical resonant orbits ( plutinos and twotinos)
	- Two populations:
		+ the **classical** Kuiper-belt objects (or "cubewanos"), which lie in orbits untouched by Neptune
		+ the **resonant** Kuiper-belt objects; those which Neptune has locked into a precise orbital ratio
* Scattered disc: 
	- Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) with large orbital eccentricities and inclinations. They have perihelia between 30 and 48 AU, aphelia greater than 60 AU, and were probably flung into their current orbits during the early Solar System through gravitational interactions with the giant planets.

* Rocky planet:
	- The atmosphere is not hot enough to ionize the gas, so there should not be ohmic dissipation.

	- Mantle is not or weal conductive, so there is no Ohmic dissipation in mantle.

### Origins of hot Jupiter:

	* Migration
	* Scattering. One is scattered to outer space, the other one left and is scattered to an eccentric orbit. It will move to a as the perihelion.

### Thermal Processing of Solids Encountering a Young Jovian Core

* More massive core -> larger radius envelope -> cooler accretion environment -> the pebble is more likely to remain N2.


### Planetesimal rings as the cause of the Solar System's planetary architecture

<img src="figures/chondrite.png" alt="scale" style="zoom:30%;" />

* Chondrite VS Solar abundance
  * Li: it is easier to be escaped from the sun with time
  * O, C, N: the volatile escape from chondrite
* Subclass
  * Carbonaceous chondrites(CC): 
  * NonCarbonaceous chondrites(NC): more consistent with rocky planet
* Jupiter can act as a barrier to block off the migration and mixing of CC and NC

<img src="figures/Jupiter-role.png" style="zoom:30%;" />

* Rather than a continuous distribution, planetesimals pile up in three different locations. It is because the snowlines of different volatiles migrate inward as the disk cools, leaving a band of planetesimals.

### Migration traps as the root cause of the Kepler dichotomy (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05342.pdf)

* Kepler dichotomy: Considering the detection bias, the observational data suggests that roughly 50% of all systems have just one planet (including non-transiting ones) and 50% have many planets (5+ for small stars).
* Previous explanation:
* This paper:
  * high-mass systems: 
    * migrate rapidly 
    * **Inner: ** more planets into orbital periods of less than 200 days.  -> **Dynamically cold** ->  low mutual $i$ and a higher probability of detecting multiple transiting planets
    * **Outer** : caught in a migration trap ‚Äî a range of planet masses and locations in which a dominant co-rotation torque prevents inward migration
  * Low-mass systems: 
    * **Inner:**  ***fewer*** planets inside 200 days -> **Dynamically hot** -> leading to collisions and high mutual $i$.
      * Fewer is the leading order, low mutual inclinations are lower order.

For perturbations below the Jeans mass, pressure forces dominate, and so the perturbation will re-expand when being compresses. But for perturbation more massive than the Jeans mass, gravity dominates, and so a perturbation will collapse even further when compressed, leading to **run-away collapse**.

    * Volatile-rich Embryos
    * Migrate
    * Resonant chain 
    * Different distance and corresponding geological process lead to different types
  * Warm disk + high metallicity+abundant short-lived radionuclides (SLR)
    * planetesimal formation throughout the disk
    * giant planets causes substructure
      * fossilizes the water snowline
      * shuts off the radial pebble flux 
    * Volatile-poor Embryos
    *  may still acquire CHNOPS later on during externally triggered instability and late veneer-like event.
