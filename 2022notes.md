### Analytical Modelling of Exoplanet Transit Specroscopy with Dimensional Analysis and Symbolic Regression


* the use of dimensional analysis to identify the relevant combinations of physical parameters (the so-called Pi
groups Barenblatt (1996)) which uniquely determine the observed transit spectra. 
* Input Pi an then the use **symbolic regression** to derive
accurate analytical formulas representative of a typical forward model

### The relation between tectonics and habitability:

Planets without such plates are known as stagnant lid planets, coping with a crust made up of a single spherical plate floating on the mantle. Should we rule out such planets as candidates for life?

Penn State’s Foley, cited above, has been working with colleague Andrew Smye on computer models that probe the idea. The scientists wanted to learn whether climate regulation through chemical weathering could be sustained on a stagnant lid planet,a place where there is no subduction and the recycling of surface material back into the mantle would be limited. On such a world, the development of continents and their productive collisions would not occur, although as the paper points out, volcanism can still release some mantle CO2 to the atmosphere, allowing for at least some degree of surface recycling through lava flows.


### Why high-O2 is not a bio signal？

The early development of abiotic, oxygen-rich atmospheres could prevent the subsequent emergence of life by precluding prebiotic chemistry (Wordsworth et al., 2018). It has also been argued that the spectral energy distributions of M-dwarfs are favorable for the photochemical accumulation of O2 and O3.
