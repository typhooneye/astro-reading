1. Why is the stratosphere isothermal?
   * At each layer of the atmosphere, in the optically thin limit, for uniform mixing ratios of atmospheric species and if heat transfer is only by radiation, the amount of IR emitted by the layer and the amount of sunlight absorbed by the layer are proportional to the mass of that layer.

2. The planets in the single star sample had a significantly higher occurrence rate outside of 1 AU than inside 1 AU by nearly 4σ, in line with expectations that giant planets are most common near the snow line. However, the planets in the wide binary systems did not follow this distribution, but rather had equivalent occurrence rates interior and exterior to 1 AU. This may point to binary-mediated planet migration acting on our sample, even in binaries wider than 100 AU.

1. Spin-Spin resonance explained by dumbbell model:
   1. It is only applied to the solid object.
   2. For the spin-spin resonance between Mercury and Sun, it depends more on the fluid viscosity of the star as Sun is a fluid object.

1. Why is the low-mean-molecular-mass atmosphere easier to be detected?
   1. H = RT/mg The lower the mean molecular mass is, the higher the scale height is, and therefore the more puffy the atmosphere is. With bigger size, there will be more transiting light and it will be easier to be detected.

#### [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05449) on the formation of solid hydrogen interstellar objects

1. Why H2?

   1. It requires non-gravitational accretion
      1. -> constrain the surface area
      2. -> H2 is the best

2. Formation of H2 core:

   1. ~2.8K core
      1. Formed in molecue clouds.
   2. Energy balance (thermal condition) -> grain size
      1. Grain size matters: non-black body; the absorption coefficient 
   3. Dust -> hailstone -> snowball
   4. **Another thermal condition**: Heat from accretion does not melt the H2 core

3. Loss of H2

    

* Dust and Grain are colder towards the center in the molecue clouds
  * Magnetic press -- non-hydrostatic equilibrium

###The New Generation Planetary Population Synthesis - Low mass stars

1. The planetary mass distribution does not linearly scale with the disk mass.

   --the ejection of smaller planets due to the giant planet

2. Earth-sized planets are most frequent around early M dwarfs(0.3-0.5)



###[ Water on hot rocky planets](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~kite/doc/Kite_and_Schaefer_ApJL_2021.pdf)

1. Less H2/H2O fraction, more H2O in the magma. 

## Jun

#### 1D model Arxiv: 2105.08009v1 

1. Compare with the observation 

#### How to get gravitational potential parameters J?

* Observe the motion of the moons
  1. From the shade on the planet
  2. Transit a star

#### Stellar Rotation from TESS

 * Why stellar rotation matters?
   * Habitability: magnetic, irradiance... 
   * Measure the stellar age
 * Method
   * Training data:
     	* Simulation + true noise (TESS galaxy data)
   * Tool: Wavelet Power Spectrum 
   * Model: convolutional neural network

#### Core-powerd mass loss V.S. Photoevaporation 

* When stellar incident is fixed, will the gap change with stellar mass?
  * Core-powerd - No: only related to the toal flux
  * photoevaporation- Yes: depend on XUV photons, so stellar mass matters when bolometric flux is fixed.

#### Long-term transit duration changes -- Multiple planet system （https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04318.）

* Observational bias -- positive relation between $\dot{T}_{dur}$ and orbital period :
  *  TDV detection requires $\dot{T}_{dur}>3 \sigma_{T_{dur}}$
  *  $\sigma_{T_{dur}}$ is higher when orbital period ($P$) is higher -- due to decreasing number of transits with longer orbital period.
 * Selection bias:
   * As the inclination variance will more easily lead to no transit for long-orbital-period exoplanets,
   * We are more likely to detect single transit planet at long orbital period.

#### GJ 1132b（ https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10487.）

* Observational uncertainties:

  *  Uncertainties are a combination of the photon shot noise from the star, sky background, dark current, and read noises added in quadrature.

  *  charge-trapping ramps

     * Ramp effect is the most prominent systematics for WFC3/IR detector (as well as other HgCdTe based detectors) in the time-series observations. 

     * Inconsecutive  observation due to low orbit.

     * the detector stabilizes faster due to higher flux levels.

#### inner 10 au region rich in C?

*  C-H bonds (such as hydrogenated nano-diamond and amorphous carbon as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), which generate infrared (IR) features that can be used to trace the solid carbon reservoirs.

#### TESS planets with 10~1000 AU (arxiv:2106.13354)

* A dearth of very closely separated binaries in systems which host exoplanets

* We do note that in exoplanet systems containing binary host stars, there is an observational bias against detecting Earth-size planet transits due to transit depth dilution caused by the companion star.
* The planet radii were estimated using the stellar radii from the TESS Input Catalog, which does not account for the multiplicity of the host stars and therefore could underestimate the radii of stars with bright, unresolved companions.

#### The magnetic field induced from an arbitrary, asymmetric ocean world (arxiv: 2106.10878)

* Any moon subjected to an oscillating magnetic field is a candidate for magnetic sounding
  * Liquid water oceans containing dissolved salts conduct electricity
  * -> Causing them to respond to oscillating fields that may be applied by their parent planet.
* **Why asymmetric? **: Close to the moon, induced magnetic moments of quadrupole and higher order will have their largest effect relative to the dominant dipole moments.
  * However, a spherically symmetric solution would predict only dipole moments are induced.
