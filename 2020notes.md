**Disturbed Naps and Black Hole Mass Gaps**

**by Sumeet Kulkarni**

> I’m someone who enjoys a sound sleep more than anything else, but I never complain when the universe calls.

• An alert on September 24, 2019 from LIGO-Virgo indicates the collision between two objects are in mass gap.

**Mass Gap**

• The stellar mass black hole are formed when very massive stars (>8 Solar mass) burn up their fuel.

• Massive enough: black hole

• Lighter: neuron star

• There is no precise line.

• Theories: heaviest neuron star-3 Solar mass

• Observation: neuron stars <2.14 solar mass; balk hole> 5 solar mass

• 2.15 ~5 mass gap

**Where the Solar System Ends?**

**by Briley Lewis**

* **The boundary?**

  1. where the Sun’s gravity stops being strong enough to hold onto things.
  2. Heliopause: where the energetic particles from the Sun (the solar wind) stop flowing away from us, blocked by the pressure of all the other gas that’s between stars, the interstellar medium(ISM). 

* **Heliopause**

  • Solar wind and ISM: plasma

  • termination shock: where the solar wind slows down below the speed of sound

  • the question that Heliopause could answer:

  • how forces and magnetic fields in the plasma of the interstellar medium confine and influence the solar wind

  • how life comes about in solar systems - it’s what protects us from dangerous cosmic rays and other high energy radiation that could be disastrous for life

  • Measurement:

  ​	• Voyager1 (2012): No expected information.

  ​		◦ A weird spot where the solar wind flows more slowly 

  ​		◦ Plasma instrument was broken

  ​	• Voyager 2 (2018):

  ​		◦ Parameters: the speed and direction of the plasma’s flow, its temperature, and its density in that region.

  ​		◦ boundary layer: where the density and magnetic field increase

  ​		◦ very different velocities of the solar wind near the boundary from Voyager 1: due to the instabilities?

  ​		◦ 8days for boundary layer and 1 day for heliopause.

  ​	◦ “very local interstellar medium” (VLISM): farther ,denser: due to the cooler environment.

 **Where Are All the Baryons?**
**by Jason Hinkle**

### The missing baton problem 
* studies of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the CMB: baryons 5%  of the universe 
* Baryons: 
  * 20%: galaxies and galasies clusters 
  * 30%: Lyman-alpha forest.
  * 50%: WHIM (warm-hot intergalactic medium).
    * because: emission from this gas is faint
    * So it is difficult to find baryons 
    * Results: 20% from absorption lines of distant quasars and X-ray absorption
* Summary: only find 70%
### Finding the WHIM
* method: thermal Sunyaev- Zeldovich (tSZ) effect: measures the change in energy of photons from the CMB caused by interactions (Compton scattering) with hot particles along our line of sight.
* Data: SDSS
* Process: add together the signals of over a million pairs of galaxies, rotating and scaling each particular pair as needed.
* Exclude the possibility that the signal from unrelated galaxies: generate tSZ map using the  control sample.
### results:
* Using constraints on the gas temperature and density from gravitational lensing and previous studies, they claim to have found an additional 11 ± 7 % of all baryons

**More metals, more planets?**
**by Spencer Wallace**
### Formation states1:
  1. dust grains around young stars collide to form pebble (roughly centimeter) sized bodies.
    * observation: infrared and radio emission from protoplanetary disks.
  2. How about the larger one?
    * spiral in and fall onto the host star (theoretical model).
    * difficult to grow further by sticking together (experiments).
    * Observations: none
    * So, need some inference.
### Clues:
* giant planets are more common around metal-rich stars.
  * Mental-rich protoplanetary disk should allow the core of the planet to form more quickly and efficiently.
  * the giant planets in the solar system are slightly more metal-rich than the Sun.
    * planet-building material might grow in locally concentrated pockets throughout the protoplanetary disk.
### Paper’s work:
  * Observations: 
    * Stellar chemical abundance: Keck, Magellan and Subaru telescopes.
    * Giant planet chemical abundance: thermal evolution model , which predicts the radius of the planet given a mass and set of chemical abundances.
      * The individual chemical abundances are then tuned until the predicted radius matches observations.
  * Analysis:
    * more massive planets tend to have lower metallicities
      * Explanation: the core accretion model suggests the mass required to trigger gas accretion is fairly universal, and so more massive giant planets simply have more hydrogen, which lowers their overall metallicity.
      * Significance: to ensure that the abundances predicted by the thermal evolution model make sense.
    * No strong correlations between the metallicity of the host star and the residual abundance
      * ‘residual’ refers to how much of a given element is present beyond what one would expect from the mass of the planet alone.
      * Explanations:
        1. the cores of giant planets only form in regions of protoplanetary disks where metals become sufficiently concentrated.
        2. dust grains and pebbles drift inwards due to gas drag and become trapped in specific regions of the disk. Once the metallicity of these regions passes some threshold, the next phase of planet formation suddenly proceeds.
  * Some guess:
    * False correlation: Stellar metallicity depends on the surrounding galactic environment. Maybe the giant planet occurrence rate is also somehow set by location in the galaxy?

**Hot planets hiding under a shroud of dust and gas**
**by Vatsal Panwar**
### A method to detect close-in low mass exoplanet through the spectra of the host stars
* Close-in orbits:⬇️
  * high levels of stellar irradiation
  * tidal stretching (https://astrobites.org/2018/09/27/changing-with-the-tide/)
	⬇️
  * ablation of dust and gas from their surface and atmosphere
	⬇️
* have a noticeable effect on the spectra of their host star
	⬇️
* Some observable effect on the population of exoplanets.
  * the Neptune desert:
    * The lack of Neptune mass planets (0.01 to 0.1 times mass of Jupiter) in close proximity (less than orbital period of 10 days) to their host star
	⬇️
* A cloud? 
  * the mass loss from some of these close-in low mass planets is hypothesized to form and sustain a cloud of optically thick material around the star
	⬇️
* Low emission line due to the cloud
  * Lower values of log R’HK imply low emission in the Calcium lines suggesting a larger optical density of material around the star
### Test:
* 17 bright main-sequence stars with low values of log R’HK
* 3 of 3 ongoing analysis are proved to be a host star of Jupiter
* Statistical analysis shows a vey low probability that it is caused by coincidence.

##### questions:
Why the emission line tends to be lower?

**The Nobel-Winning Discovery of 51 Pegasi b**
**by Briley Lewis**
### Radial Velocity:
  * the motion of the star and planet around their common center of mass
  * Doppler effect -- spectra

### 51 Peg b
* Wired: twice the size of Jupiter, but about 7 times closer to its star than Mercury is to our sun
* Why wired: too close
  * those gases need cooler temperatures (beyond the “snow line”) to coalesce and form a planet
* Possible explanations: 
  * moved inwards towards the star
  * it could have been a brown dwarf that lost some of its atmosphere due to the high temperatures from 51 Pegasi
  * Confirmed one: a Jupiter that formed farther away from 51 Pegasi and migrated inwards towards the star, for one reason or another.
* The most common type of planet:
  * between the size of the Earth and Neptune
* Other process that could cause variations in RV:
  * stellar variability, 
  * spot rotation,
  *  pulsation.

## Unlocking the secrets of chaotic planetary systems
###### by Spencer Wallace

*  certain arrangements of planets are inherently unstable
	* Explanation: if you place them in a certain configuration and let them orbit their star for long enough, the gravitational interactions between the planets will fling some (or sometimes all) of the bodies clear out of the system.
* Objective: The authors of today’s paper want to examine how reliable the estimates of instability timescales from these simulations actually are.
* Work:
	* Step1: For each simulation, the orbits and sizes of the planets were varied and planetary configuration was then evolved for a billion or so orbits 
	* IF system became unstable
	* Step2: the timescale for instability was recorded and the same configuration was run again with the initial conditions tweaked ever so slightly to probe the underlying chaotic behavior.
* Results: the distribution of instability times for a given configuration of planets fell into two broad categories.
	* Case1: the distribution was very sharply peaked around a single value.
	* Case2: the distribution had a log-normal shape.
* Explanation: It depends on whether the instability timescale or the Lyapunov timescale are longer.
	* For the sharply peaked distribution, the planets become unstable before chaos sets in. This results in an instability time that is not sensitive to slight changes in the initial conditions.
	* For the broadly peaked distributions, chaos occurs well before the instability.
* Interesting finding: the log-normal distributions all have a width of ~0.4 dex, regardless of the differences in the initial conditions.
	* regardless of whether the instability time is short or long, or whether the planets are arranged randomly or placed in mean motion resonances.
	* The only requirements here are that the planets start off in a compact configuration and the Lyapunov time be shorter than the instability time.

## Extreme star-forming galaxy reveals all…!?
###### by Joanna Ramasawmy 

### submillimetre galaxies (SMGs)
* Before: Low resolution: submillimetre telescopes are limited by the feasible sizes of single mirrors
* Now: ALMA has high resolution thanks to the interferometry
* Results: many of these very bright sources turn out to be the combined light of several galaxies
* Findings:
	* W — is so bright in the submillimetre that it classifies as a rare hyperluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG)
		* implying a star formation rate of many thousands of stars per year
### More about W:
* confilict observations
	*  From optical and X-ray spectroscopy, they determine that galaxy W does indeed host an AGN.
	*  mid infrared: no dust signature 
		* conflict with the UV 
* Two mergeing AGN?
	* that of a young dusty AGN with a high star formation rate, and an evolved neighbour with an unobscured AGN.
*  SMBH being flung out of the galaxy?
	* galaxy W continues to form stars, without the presence of an AGN which could regulate its star formation, giving rise to the unusually high star formation rate & infrared luminosity that classes it as a HyLIRG.

## What happens when you throw a satellite at the Sun?
###### by by Briley Lewis

## Goal:
* to understand the plasma, magnetic fields, and charged particles near the surface of the Sun
## Status:
* Now that the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) has completed its first two close passages of the Sun (out of 24 total planned!)
## Science:
* Previous knowladge: 
	* supersonic solar wind
	* the plasma around the Sun is somehow accelerated as it leaves the corona, transporting energy into that solar wind
* Now:
	* information: variation of density of particles, velocity of the wind, and temperature. 
	* findings:
	1. repeated spikes
	2. the magnetic fields seemed to be bent into an S-shape
	3. a net rotational flow around the Sun.(higher than expected)
		* Stars are known to lose angular momentum through their stellar winds
	4. a possible solution to the long-standing coronal heating problem (how is the Sun’s corona so hot?)-- Alfven waves

## The Beating Heart(-Shaped Region) of Pluto
###### by Kaitlyn Shin

### The heart region
* The heart region in Pluto named Tombaugh Regio after Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930.
* the left side of the heart, named “Sputnik Planitia” after the first artificial satellite
* the left part is much younger than the other side of the heart.( less than 10 million years)

### putnik Planitia 
* a basin (sitting at about 1.9 miles (3 km) below the rest of the terrain).
* holds most of Pluto’s nitrogen ice
* unable to be explained by the older atmospheric model
	* evidence: the presence of darker plains enriched in dark red material and in methane.

### Work:
* motivation: to investigate the role of atmospheric circulation in shaping these mysterious geological features.
* data: New Horizons topography data 
* model: an updated high-resolution version of a 3D global climate model developed at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique
* findings:
	*  there is an atmospheric current that flows counterclockwise over Sputnik Planitia
		* caused by the warming of some nitrogen ice into vapor during the day, and then the vapor condensing back into ice at night
	* These winds appear to be moving in the opposite direction (westward) of Pluto’s rotation (eastward)
	* dominate the atmospheric circulation.
	* to explain the dark streaks: Some of these westward winds blow close enough to the surface to transport heat, ice grains, and other small particles—such as haze particles, which could darken and erode ice—and explain the dark streaks and plains just west of Sputnik Planitia.

## More Clues to the Environment in Which FRBs Originate?
###### by Haley Wahl 

* FRB was first discovered by Dr. Duncan Lorimer in 2007 
* a discovery in 2016 showed that they can actually repeat.
* Two types of questions about FRB
	* Q1:What causes the bursts?
	*Q2:How can they be put to use
* New finding: a newly discovered FRB with a very high rotation measure
### Rotation Measures
* Faraday rotated: a rotation of the orientation of the light by a magnetic field.
* Rotation Measures:  How much that light gets rotated as it travels
	* depends on: 
		* the magnetic field between us and the source, 
		* the density of the material that the light is going through, 
		* the distance to the source
	* range: -100 rad m-2 to -120 rad m-2
	* newly found: 500 rad m-2
* Signal: RM from the Milky Way + the RM from the medium between galaxies + the RM of the host itself. 
	* extragalactic contribution： 525 rad m-2
	* require the magnetic field between galaxies to be 1000x greater than they are
	* from the ionized material surrounding the two galaxies? No! beacause other sources around M33 have RMs of <100 rad m-2
	* explanation: originated from an area of very dense, magnetized material in the host galaxy
	* no radio counterpart
	* don't repeat

## Deciphering Spitzer’s Legacy: Signs of Dead Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn
###### by John Weaver 

### Spitzer
* retired: Jan 30 2020
* instruments:
	* the Infrared Camera (IRAC), 
	* Infrared Spectrograph (IRS), 
	* Multiband Imager (MIPS)
* scientific results:
	* the nature of star-formation, 
	* the formation of exoplanets,
	* the dusty structures within the galaxies
### The IRAC excess
* difficulties to discover th galaxies in the early universe:
	* dimming light duting the distance
	* redshift
	* less spectroscopy to imaging (wide-field sky survey need efficient way)
* Spitzer object: extremely distant galaxies seen at z>5(one billion years of the Big Bang)
	* the light is redshifted into the 3.6 and 4.5 um channels of IRAC
* findings:
	* old knowaledge: nearby galaxies show strong connection between that emission lines from ionized gas and intense star-formation. 
	* IRAC-excess galaxies: have strong Lyman-alpha emission which not only implies strong star-formation but also at 7<z<9 whereby the [OIII] and Hβ emission lines fall into the 4.5um channel
	* galaxies z=9.11: features in 4.5um band:  the 4000Å break
		* a lack of young O and B stars, implying a dearth of star-formation.
		* indication: not only that this galaxy was one of the first to form in our universe, but that it has also lived and died on an unbelievably short timescale.

	* method: using known relations, checking their spectral energy distributions against known spectra, and using spectroscopy
	* no flares from the star in the observations over five years
* Puzzles about the largest planet in the missle of the system
	* Solar system: the inner planets are small and rocky while the outer planets are larger and gaseous
	* explanation1:  the two inner planets forming faster and accreting significant gaseous envelopes and the outer one forming more slowly and accreting less gas, then the innermost planet loses its envelope somehow. 
	* explanation2: the middle planet formed outside the outermost planet but migrated inward somehow

## Red Galaxies at Night, Astronomers’ Delight!
###### by Mitchell Cavanagh

### Galaxies:
* contain: hundreds of billions of stars
* location is an important parameter
* the star formation rate (SFR): how active the galaxy is
	* the overall star formation rate of galaxies in the universe has decreased over time
	* peak star formation having already occurred in the early universe
### Work
* Goal: determining whether this general reduction applies across all environments.
* Samples: 
	* high-redshift Group Environment and Evolution Collaboration (GEEC) 
	* low-redshift Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
* methods:
	* to get SFR: fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to each sample
		1. using a set of template SEDs from galaxies with known parameters
			* model input: initial mass function (a function that describes the initial distribution of stellar masses)
			* model function: can compute the spectral properties of that population over time
		2. obtain the galaxy parameters that best fit the observed SED given the template SED
	* to separate pairs of samples: friends-of-friends algorithm
	* compare samples with different masses: using specific SFR (SSFR) – the ratio of the SFR divided by the stellar mass
	
* a birth rate b:
	* description: multiplying the SSFR by the age of the Universe (in years)
	* function: If this birth rate is greater than 1, then the galaxy is forming stars more quickly than it has in the past (and vice versa). 
	* results: The set of galaxy samples at around log10 SSFR = −10
	* the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies:  b ~ 1 suggesting that they have been forming stars at this rate for most of their lifetime
	* quiescent galaxies: The clumps of samples below the red line
* other evidence: the high redshift GEEC samples have consistently higher mean SSFRs than the low redshift SDSS samples. 
* environmen? 
	* passive galaxies: (those that have stopped forming stars)
	* evidence1: that star-forming galaxies in all environments show a systematic, mass-independent lowering of SFR from z = 0.4 (around 4 billion years ago) to z = 0.08 (about 1 billion years ago)
	* evidence2: the fraction of passive galaxies is higher in group galaxies than in field galaxies
	* explanation:  Accretion models, strangulation
		* hot gas surrounding a galaxy is stripped when the galaxy becomes a satellite of a massive dark matter halo
	* “green” galaxies:  those in transition from active to passive

### usage of imaging planets
* how much carbon there is compared to oxygen (the C/O ratio) ---- where it formed in the protoplanetary disk.
* D/H ratio (deuterium to hydrogen) ---- how many icy bodies (like Kuiper Belt Objects) a planet must have accreted in its past.
### technique
* difficluties: resolution
* solution: Interferometry
### paper's work:
*  techniques: ESO’s VLTI and its GRAVITY instrument 
* target: HR 8799 e 
* precision: measurements narrowed down the position to tens of microarcseconds
* results: the planets around HR 8799 aren’t coplanar
*  spectroscopy:
	* The authors compared this to atmospheric models, which generate spectra for different kinds of atmospheres that the authors can then compare to the observed spectrum.
