**Do we need to expand the cosmological standard model? New cepheid observations suggest yes**

by Laila Linke

**1. Hubble tension**

* Description: the discrepancy between measurements of the Hubble parameter by the Planck satellite (67.4 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc ) and in the local universe (72.04 ± 2.67 km/s/Mpc).

  ​	\1. Local Universe: 

  ​				• Standard Candles(SN Ia)

  ​				• H0=c z/D

* Explanation:

  ​	• additional dark energy in the early universe. 

  ​	• new neutrino species.

**2. Distance measurement**

* Distance ladder: 

  ​	\1. Parallax 

  ​	\2. Cepheids (period-luminosity relation)

  ​	\3. SN Ia

* Problem:

  * Cepheids from ground-based observation, which has introduce a 1.4-1.8% error 

   * SN Ia from HST in space which has smaller error

**3. Paper’s work**

*  Use the Cepheids observed by HST to refine the period-luminosity relation.
*  Reduced the error.
*  Indicate a stronger Tension,

**Disturbed Naps and Black Hole Mass Gaps**

**by Sumeet Kulkarni**

> I’m someone who enjoys a sound sleep more than anything else, but I never complain when the universe calls.

• An alert on September 24, 2019 from LIGO-Virgo indicates the collision between two objects are in mass gap.

**Mass Gap**

• The stellar mass black hole are formed when very massive stars (>8 Solar mass) burn up their fuel.

• Massive enough: black hole

• Lighter: neuron star

• There is no precise line.

• Theories: heaviest neuron star-3 Solar mass

• Observation: neuron stars <2.14 solar mass; balk hole> 5 solar mass

• 2.15 ~5 mass gap

**Where the Solar System Ends?**

**by Briley Lewis**

* **The boundary?**

  1. where the Sun’s gravity stops being strong enough to hold onto things.
  2. Heliopause: where the energetic particles from the Sun (the solar wind) stop flowing away from us, blocked by the pressure of all the other gas that’s between stars, the interstellar medium(ISM). 

* **Heliopause**

  • Solar wind and ISM: plasma

  • termination shock: where the solar wind slows down below the speed of sound

  • the question that Heliopause could answer:

  • how forces and magnetic fields in the plasma of the interstellar medium confine and influence the solar wind

  • how life comes about in solar systems - it’s what protects us from dangerous cosmic rays and other high energy radiation that could be disastrous for life

  • Measurement:

  ​	• Voyager1 (2012): No expected information.

  ​		◦ A weird spot where the solar wind flows more slowly 

  ​		◦ Plasma instrument was broken

  ​	• Voyager 2 (2018):

  ​		◦ Parameters: the speed and direction of the plasma’s flow, its temperature, and its density in that region.

  ​		◦ boundary layer: where the density and magnetic field increase

  ​		◦ very different velocities of the solar wind near the boundary from Voyager 1: due to the instabilities?

  ​		◦ 8days for boundary layer and 1 day for heliopause.

  ​	◦ “very local interstellar medium” (VLISM): farther ,denser: due to the cooler environment.

 **Where Are All the Baryons?**
**by Jason Hinkle**

### The missing baton problem 
* studies of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the CMB: baryons 5%  of the universe 
* Baryons: 
  * 20%: galaxies and galasies clusters 
  * 30%: Lyman-alpha forest.
  * 50%: WHIM (warm-hot intergalactic medium).
    * because: emission from this gas is faint
    * So it is difficult to find baryons 
    * Results: 20% from absorption lines of distant quasars and X-ray absorption
* Summary: only find 70%
### Finding the WHIM
* method: thermal Sunyaev- Zeldovich (tSZ) effect: measures the change in energy of photons from the CMB caused by interactions (Compton scattering) with hot particles along our line of sight.
* Data: SDSS
* Process: add together the signals of over a million pairs of galaxies, rotating and scaling each particular pair as needed.
* Exclude the possibility that the signal from unrelated galaxies: generate tSZ map using the  control sample.
### results:
* Using constraints on the gas temperature and density from gravitational lensing and previous studies, they claim to have found an additional 11 ± 7 % of all baryons

**More metals, more planets?**
**by Spencer Wallace**
### Formation states1:
  1. dust grains around young stars collide to form pebble (roughly centimeter) sized bodies.
    * observation: infrared and radio emission from protoplanetary disks.
  2. How about the larger one?
    * spiral in and fall onto the host star (theoretical model).
    * difficult to grow further by sticking together (experiments).
    * Observations: none
    * So, need some inference.
### Clues:
* giant planets are more common around metal-rich stars.
  * Mental-rich protoplanetary disk should allow the core of the planet to form more quickly and efficiently.
  * the giant planets in the solar system are slightly more metal-rich than the Sun.
    * planet-building material might grow in locally concentrated pockets throughout the protoplanetary disk.
### Paper’s work:
  * Observations: 
    * Stellar chemical abundance: Keck, Magellan and Subaru telescopes.
    * Giant planet chemical abundance: thermal evolution model , which predicts the radius of the planet given a mass and set of chemical abundances.
      * The individual chemical abundances are then tuned until the predicted radius matches observations.
  * Analysis:
    * more massive planets tend to have lower metallicities
      * Explanation: the core accretion model suggests the mass required to trigger gas accretion is fairly universal, and so more massive giant planets simply have more hydrogen, which lowers their overall metallicity.
      * Significance: to ensure that the abundances predicted by the thermal evolution model make sense.
    * No strong correlations between the metallicity of the host star and the residual abundance
      * ‘residual’ refers to how much of a given element is present beyond what one would expect from the mass of the planet alone.
      * Explanations:
        1. the cores of giant planets only form in regions of protoplanetary disks where metals become sufficiently concentrated.
        2. dust grains and pebbles drift inwards due to gas drag and become trapped in specific regions of the disk. Once the metallicity of these regions passes some threshold, the next phase of planet formation suddenly proceeds.
  * Some guess:
    * False correlation: Stellar metallicity depends on the surrounding galactic environment. Maybe the giant planet occurrence rate is also somehow set by location in the galaxy?

**Hot planets hiding under a shroud of dust and gas**
**by Vatsal Panwar**
### A method to detect close-in low mass exoplanet through the spectra of the host stars
* Close-in orbits:⬇️
  * high levels of stellar irradiation
  * tidal stretching (https://astrobites.org/2018/09/27/changing-with-the-tide/)
	⬇️
  * ablation of dust and gas from their surface and atmosphere
	⬇️
* have a noticeable effect on the spectra of their host star
	⬇️
* Some observable effect on the population of exoplanets.
  * the Neptune desert:
    * The lack of Neptune mass planets (0.01 to 0.1 times mass of Jupiter) in close proximity (less than orbital period of 10 days) to their host star
	⬇️
* A cloud? 
  * the mass loss from some of these close-in low mass planets is hypothesized to form and sustain a cloud of optically thick material around the star
	⬇️
* Low emission line due to the cloud
  * Lower values of log R’HK imply low emission in the Calcium lines suggesting a larger optical density of material around the star
### Test:
* 17 bright main-sequence stars with low values of log R’HK
* 3 of 3 ongoing analysis are proved to be a host star of Jupiter
* Statistical analysis shows a vey low probability that it is caused by coincidence.

##### questions:
Why the emission line tends to be lower?

**The Nobel-Winning Discovery of 51 Pegasi b**
**by Briley Lewis**
### Radial Velocity:
  * the motion of the star and planet around their common center of mass
  * Doppler effect -- spectra

### 51 Peg b
* Wired: twice the size of Jupiter, but about 7 times closer to its star than Mercury is to our sun
* Why wired: too close
  * those gases need cooler temperatures (beyond the “snow line”) to coalesce and form a planet
* Possible explanations: 
  * moved inwards towards the star
  * it could have been a brown dwarf that lost some of its atmosphere due to the high temperatures from 51 Pegasi
  * Confirmed one: a Jupiter that formed farther away from 51 Pegasi and migrated inwards towards the star, for one reason or another.
* The most common type of planet:
  * between the size of the Earth and Neptune
* Other process that could cause variations in RV:
  * stellar variability, 
  * spot rotation,
  *  pulsation.
