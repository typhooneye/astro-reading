### Migration and Stability of Multi-planet Circumbinary Systems

###### E. Fitzmaurice (OSU)

1. Facts:
   1. Absence of small planet (Super-Earth) in circumbinary systems.
2. Hypothesis:
   1. Observational effect -- It needs to be addressed.
   2. Perturbation from the disk -- It needs to be strong enough to eject the small planets.
   3. Perturbation from an outer planet -- It's sufficient to do that.





###### S Wang (IU)

* The demographics of single planets are similar to the sample only in mutual-planets -- **If the sample is Teff controlled!**
* Why Teff controlled makes difference -- **Hotter dynamics around hotter stars**
  * Obliquity of planets around hotter stars are excited.
* Why Teff rather than mass?



### Sub-Neptune M-R relation revised by the interaction of magma ocean and atmosphere

###### Bowen Fan

1. **Facts** : The atmosphere of sub-Neptune is so thick that the pressure and temperature at the bottom of the atmos can melt the rock.
2. **Impact:** The core is puffed up by the dissolved gas.
3. **Conclusion**:  
   * “Puffed-up” core effect is strong when solubility >0.1
   * "Puffed-up" core effect is strong for thick atmos but also take effect for thin atmos.

4. **Questions**:
   1. Neptune is rare in exoplanets. -- "cliff". We don't know the interaction details in our Neptune.

### Small bodies in the solar system

###### Darryl Seligman

1. **Facts**:

   1. Trans-Neptune -> Centaur -> Jupiter Family
   2. The comet between Jupiter and Saturn

### Testing Self-Organized Criticality Across the Main Sequence using Stellar Flares from TESS

###### A. Feinstein (UofC)

1. **Concepts**
   1. Self-organized criticality



### EUV irradiation from exoplanet atmosphere ~Gyrs

###### G King (UMich)

1. **Facts**: 
   1. The evolution of X-ray: Flat when t<t_sat; decay exponentially when t>t_sat. 
      1. t_sat: saturation timescale (Myrs?)

### **Masses and Compositions of Planets Around Nearby M dwarfs**

###### Madison Brady

1. **Facts**:
   1. Planets around M-dwarfs, even in HZ, suffers a lot of XUV.
   2. Snowline is close to the star.
2. **Goals**:
   1. Core mass fraction
   2. Mass distribution
   3. Water content

### High-resolution Exoplanet Spectroscopy with Novel Smoothing Algorithm

1. What they do: Better normalization and smoothing method to upgrade the spectral of planets

2. Facts:

   1. Spectra of exoplanets include:
      1. Star: don't move
      2. Earth's atmosphere: tellurics: move in depth but not position
      3. Planet's atmosphere: move in position and depth

   2. What need to do:
      1. Normalization: Flat
      2. Detrend: smoothing



### Active magnetic drag on Hot Jupiter

###### Hayley Beltz (UM) - remote

1. **Concept:**

   1. Magnetic Drag Timescale; the time when the zonal wind is decreased to half strength.

2. **Previous**:

   1. Apply uniform magnetic drag timescale **globally**.

3. Their Work:

   1. Assumptions:

      * Bi-pole along the rotational axis

      --> only east-west drag but not north-south drag

   2. Different timescale with pressure

4. Conclusion:

   1. With stronger magnetic, the east-west wind caused by day-night contrast is muted.
   2. Equatorial jets are muted when the magnetic field is strong ~30 Guass
