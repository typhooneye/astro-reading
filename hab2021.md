# Monday

##A. Terrestrial planet atmospheres are connected to their interiors

###### Laura Schaefer

### 1. Magma Ocean 

1. Structure & boundary

   Metallic core -- *partitioning*-- Solid --*partitioning* --melt --*solubility*-- atmosphere

2. How solubility & partition depend on oxide or reduced?
   * Solubility: some is reversed
   * Partition: increasing
3. Atmosphere
  
   1. Solidation?
4. Exosphere: atmosphere+ocean+crust

### 2. Cycle

1.  Water/carbon in the mantle

1. Cycle: Outgas + subduction
   1. Carbon cycle 
   2. Deep water cycle
2. plate tectonics vs. stagnant lid



## B. A New Method to Measure the Chemical Compositions of Extrasolar Planets

### 1. Method:

* Measure the debris of the circumstellar gas around the WD to measure the composition of the planets.
* Chemical model + dynamics model

### 2. Observation:

* Two peaks shown in the velocity of the emission lines

##C. Identifying biosignatures depends on the whole planetary context.

### 1. Biosignature in planetary context

* geochemical evolution 
* Redox: 氧化还原作用

###2. Oxgen

* Oxgenic - rare photonthesis?
* Oxgen rich - rare atmosphere?

### 3. Methane









# Wednesday

##A. How can the outcome of atmospheric models be tested through observation

###### Eliza Kempton

## B. What observables are needed to better constraint atmospheric (GCM) modeling

###### Eric Wolf

### 1. GCM on Earth

* Things get fuzzy when back to time
* Weather; paleoclimate; numerical method; + ...

### 2. GCM in Solar System

* Mars

### 3. GCM on exoplanet

* Phase curve 

## C. Effects of Rotation Rate on the Habitability of Earth-Like Planets Using NASA’s ROCKE-3D GCM

###### Tiffany Jansen

* T decreases as rotational period decreases. (**?**)

* What I can use in my pre

* Rotational Goldilock zone?

  * Peak in habitability rate
  * Decrease in weathering rate
  * Decrease in precipitation
  * Peak in runoff
  * ↑3 factors-> peak in relative weathering rate

### Questions:

1. What are piling up around the equator? (Fig1/2?)

### Thinkings 

1. I like how they present their results. -- putting the statistical results first and explain it later with more small figures.



## C.  Seasonal Changes in Titan’s Atmosphere from the Cassini Mission

###### Athena Coustenis

* CH4 v4 -> temperature 
* T profile / P Profile - comparison between different time (MM/YYYY) - 

### Questions:

1. What is CH4 $\nu_4$ band?

2. The pressure profile changes with seasons?
3. Is the month "Earth month"? How does it relate to TItan's season? 

### D. Earth as an Exoplanet: Comparing Earthshine Observations to Models of an Exo-Earth

###### Kenneth Gordon

* Method: polarization 
  * Vectorized radiation
* Observational Data: Earth shine
* Model data: MODIS

### Questions:

* Is the vectorized radiation a general method? What are the advantages? (*polarimetry*)
* Slide 7: what is the y-axis?
  * 
* Slide 9: What's the reason for the two peaks?

### E. Constraining Chemical Disequilibrium Biosignatures for an Earth-Like Exoplanet Using Retrieval Analysis Techniques

* Chemical disequilibrium - has not reached equilibrium.
* Index: Gibbs free energy
  * Available free energy:  Initial GFE - final GFE
  * -> observable
* Method: Retrieval - generate noisy spectrum  

### Questions:

* How can we obtain $\Delta$GFE from the spectrum.



# Thursday

## A. Core Formation Sets the Thickness, Composition, and Surface Evolution of Rocky Planet Crust

###### Brendan Dyck

* CMF: Core mass fraction

### Model Set-up

1. Stage 1:

2. Stage 2:

3. Stage 3:



* How gravity influence the 
* Bulk chemistry -> minelology of the crust ->volatile cycling
  * Thermodology

### Questions:

* How do we measure CMF?
  * We cannot do that. But if we know the chemical composition and other information, we can do that.

## B. How Seafloor Weathering Affects Planetary Habitability

###### John Chambers

### Model

* Surface temperature: set by insolation +green house gas:CO2 + water vapor

* two processes:
  * Seafloor weathering: extract CO2 from atmos
  * Outgas: add CO2

* Ice free -> ice covered
* Climate depends on the distance & time? 

### Questions:

* Do you set the ice free/covered or let it evolve with the surface temperature?
